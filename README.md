# DDE  /A drift-aware dynamic ensemble model with two-stage model selection for carbon price forecasting/

This repository contains the code for implementing a dynamic drift-aware ensemble (DDE) learning framework for carbon price forecasting.  The framework is designed to adaptively select and combine models based on data distribution and performance changes.

# Main Documentation
The main code for running the DDE framework is located in the file Main_DDE.py.  This script handles the core functionality of the framework, including data processing, model selection, and forecasting.

# Input Data
The input data required for the DDE framework is stored in HBEA_Input.  This dataset contains all necessary historical and feature-engineered data needed for model training and forecasting.

# Future Updates
More detailed code, including additional modules and explanations, is currently being organized.  Once the related article is officially published in the Energy journal, the full codebase will be made publicly available.
