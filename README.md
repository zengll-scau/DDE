# DDE framework  /A drift-aware dynamic ensemble model with two-stage model selection for carbon price forecasting/

This repository contains the code for implementing a dynamic drift-aware ensemble (DDE) learning framework for carbon price forecasting.

# Main Documentation
The main code for running the DDE framework is located in the file Main_DDE.py.  This script handles the core functionality of the framework, including data processing, model selection, and forecasting.

# Input Data
This study selects emission allowances of Hubei (HBEA), Guangdong (GDEA), Shanghai (SHEA) and Beijing (BJEA) for analysis. Therefore, the input data for the framework includes four datasets:
  HBEA_Input,
  GDEA_Input,
  SHEA_Input,
  BJEA_Input,
Currently, we are showcasing the data from the HBEA_Input dataset.

# Future Updates
More detailed code, including additional modules and explanations, is currently being organized.  Once the related article is officially published in the Energy journal, the full codebase will be made publicly available.
